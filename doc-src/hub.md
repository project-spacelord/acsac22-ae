# Hub Image

Hub images can be downloaded at the following addresses.

TODO: Build and upload images, add links

- RockPro64
- iMX8MQ
- QEMU (for artifact evaluation without hardware)

For hardware based evaluation,
an SSD and eMMC card are required in addition to the board.
Upload the downloaded image to the eMMC card with a disk flashing tool
(e.g., Etcher, dd). [Example](https://wiki.radxa.com/Rockpi4/install/eMMC).
